# Netnix

An Android-based TV show tracker with a parodical name that's only funny in Dutch. The app was unfortunately abandoned due to lack of time, and as such never released. Feel free to take samples of the code and use it in your own projects. Or even fork and make it your own! Everything is open source for a reason. If you do decide to release the app, please make sure to rebrand it. You **will most likely** get in legal trouble with Netflix if you use this logo and name. 

The app was written with performance and efficiency as the main priority. Making clever use of Android's caching system and asynchronous API requests to keep the application lightweight.

Copyright of the logo fully goes to Netflix, as it obviously is a blatant rip-off.
